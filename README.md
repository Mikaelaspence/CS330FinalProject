# CS330FinalProject

How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software currently by following tutorials and trying to follow best practices like using conventional naming techniques and commenting my code appropriately. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
It was interesting to try to take a real 3D scene and render it in OpenGL. I had no experience with this before, so deciding on which shapes to use to recreate objects, especially the complex objects was something that took a little practice. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I started by writing out what shapes I thought I would need to recreate each object in my scene. Once I had an idea of what I would need, I imported those shapes into the project and resized and moved them to where they needed to be. Then I chose appropriate textures and added lighting to the scene.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Using the techniques for laying textures and adding lighting I can see using in my future work. My plan for this degree is to write code for and design games, and modeling objects, adding textures, and adding lighting will be very important to create a realistic 3D world.

How do I approach developing programs?
I start by coming up with a plan. I write out my ideas and the tools I will need. Once I have a good plan in place and the materials I need, I start to actually develop my programs. 

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I had never worked with lighitng at all in any project, and this was something that I closely followed tutorials to get to work. It was not easy for me and I am not completely happy with the results. I know I need more practice in that area in particular. 

How did iteration factor into your development?
Eacch time I made a change I checked the result. I needed to run my program many times to make sure objects were in the right place, that textures actually rendered, etc. Each little change required checking again and again.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
A lot of my work was based off of the other projects due each week. These helped give me a sense of direction. Following the tutorials was helpful, as well as a few outside resources for clarification. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I want to develop games and computer science is a huge part of that. I do not only want to use tools like blueprints to do so, and learning how to write programs will be vital. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
It was great to learn about modeling techniques and textures. In game design, these are important to create the world the player will exist in. Lighting techniques are also important to add to the realistic environment for the player.
